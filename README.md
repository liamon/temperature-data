# temperature-data
This was an assignment in First Year in the Programming module.
I originally handed it up as a single file, but for GitHub I have split it into three more modular files.

## Assignment Description
>- You are to write a program that allows the user to enter temperature readings for different towns via the command line, e.g.
>
>        prog.exe Galway 25.0 Lisbon 34.0 Paris 24.0 Belmullet 23.0
>- The user must be able to enter as many readings as they want.
>- The program must save the data to a tab-delimited file as shown, and also add an extra line at the end of the file saying which town was the hottest, e.g.
>
>        Galway 25.000000
>        Lisbon 34.000000
>        Paris 24.000000
>        Belmullet 23.000000
>        Hottest Town On This Day Is: Lisbon(34.00)
>- The name of the file must be the date, and the type .txt, e.g.
>
>        Mar 7 2016.txt
